/*
    2SF Decoder: for playing Nintendo DS Sound Format files (.2SF/.MINI2SF).

    Based on kode54's: https://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_input_vio2sf (version 0.24.16)
    and on my earlier port of the similar GSF player.

    As compared to kode54's original 2sf.cpp, the code has been patched to NOT
    rely on any fubar2000 base impls.  (The migration must have messed up
    the original "silence suppression" impl - which seems to be rather crappy
    anyway and not worth the trouble - and it has just been disabled here.)

    Note: kode54's various psflib based decoder impls (see gsf, PSX, etc) use a copy/paste
    approach that amounts to 90% of the respective impls. It just seems bloody
    stupid to not pull out the respective code into some common shared base impl -
    but I really don't feel like cleaning up kode54's mess.

    NOTE: This emulator seems to make a total mess of the big/little endian handling
    (see mem.h where the respective impls do exactly the inverse of what their names suggest),
    i.e. it seems that in *some* cases the memory layout is inverse - but not
    always (see LE_TO_LOCAL_32).
